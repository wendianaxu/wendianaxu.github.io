                    <p>I am a senior at Middlebury College studying Psychology and Computer Science, graduating in Februrary 2024. </p>
                    <p>I am interested in understanding how people <strong>reason and make decisions</strong> regarding abstract and complex problems, especially with the aid of <strong>visual information</strong>. </p>
                    <p>I hope to leverage these insights to design visual communication that reduces <strong>cognitive biases</strong> and facilitates <strong>behavior change</strong> regarding problems that call for collective action. </p>

                        <h2>Concrete Data Visualization Designs</h2>
                        <p><em>Can visualization design choices lead people to see information in more concrete lens? </em></p>
                        <p>Traditional forms of data visualizations, such as a bar chart, abstract individual data points into aggregate geometric elements. Some visualization practitioners argue that this form of visualization distant the audience from what the data represent in the real world. When used to raise concerns in issues such as human suffering, abstract visualizations can fail to evoke empathy. </p>
                        <p>In my senior thesis project, I am investigating how we can design visualizations that prime viewers to think in a <strong>concrete mindset</strong>. I use the <strong>Construal Level Theory</strong> in psychology to understand how concrete visualization designs may affect people’s engagement with information in a variety of ways, from bringing things closer to emphasizing concrete factors in decision making. </p>

                        <h2>Climate Change Perception and Decision Making</h2>
                        <p><em>When does bringing climate impacts closer motivate action and when does it backfire? </em></p>
                        <p>There is an <em>“attitude-behavior gap”</em> when it comes to the climate crisis: people are not taking enough action that matches their expressed concerns. One reason could be that the impacts of climate change are not perceived as close and tangible enough to drive behavioral change. We tend to see climate change as influencing <strong>distant</strong> places in the far future. </p>
                        <p>Surprisingly, some research have found that learning about local climate impacts made people even <em>less</em> willing to take action. Could proximal impacts become too threatening and evoke denial and desperation? My research aims to untangle the relationship between the <strong>psychological distance</strong> of climate change and intentions to act by looking into other factors in play, such as one’s personal values and perceived efficacy of their own actions. The findings will hopefully inform how we communicate the climate crisis, along with other environmental and societal problems that feel distant and abstract, in order to promote behavioral change for the good. </p>
